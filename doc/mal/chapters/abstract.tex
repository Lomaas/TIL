Sports science is an increasingly hot topic and more and more soccer teams are investing time and money into strategic development of big data and sports science. All this to increase player’s performance on the field and reduce the risk of injuries. Soccer teams and athletes in general are constantly looking for possibilities to gain advantages over opponents. In soccer your next opponent is analyzed down to the smallest details to find weaknesses and strengths. It is all about winning, and a step on the road to success is to take advantage of the opponent’s weak points and limit their strengths.

This project creates and evaluates a system for capturing events relevant for soccer opponent analysis and an interface that presents the information gathered.
