This chapter outlines the requirement specification of the system. This section describes the requirement analysis process. The process of gathering the requirements was done in collaboration with Troms√∏ IL.

\section{Overview}

The requirements evolved during the process of developing the system. Initially a requirement specification was designed from our perspective. We looked at the different analyze systems out there and what was in use at Alfheim. Rather than going very wide providing all kind of analyses and statistics we narrowed it down to a very concrete system. A system that tries to to for many things may fell between two chairs, and at the end of the day not providing anything. You spend less time on each feature as you have more features thus reducing the quality on each feature.

The imagined system shall give you the key players in the offensive play of a given opponent soccer team. You shall be able to search on teams and individual players. Additionally you shall be able to see which areas of the pitch players are creating goal chances from. The system also needs a way of capturing data. This shall be an interface that enables you to store successful attacks for any match.

\section{Capture}

Domain model
Storage


A domain model for the captured data is crucial to set early and don't change it radically. Initially we wanted to build a database of all the matches in the Norwegian premier league. From each match every successful attack a team makes should be captured. From the attack started you registrate where the attack started, every pass including from/to co-ordinates, and what type of attack the attack can be categorized as. At last if there is a breaking point in the attack this should be captured. The breaking point of the attack is stored with a breakthrough player and what type of breakthrough it was.

\caption{Illustrations of different breakthroughs we want to registrate}
\label{overflow}
\end{figure}

A definition of what a breakthrough player is: A player that does something extra that unbalance the other team. This can be a dribble past 1-2 players or a genius pass that opens deference of the opponents team. 

First problem was how to divide the pitch into zones. As we are looking for which zones the breaking point of the attack this is crucial for the searches on the data captured later on. During the development of the system several types of dividing was presented to the coaching staff. 

\begin{figure}[ht!]

\includegraphics[width=100mm]{images/general/second_zones.png}
\caption{Dividing of pitch - the second suggestion had 24 zones}
\label{overflow}
\end{figure}

\section{Present}

The presentation of the data is a important aspect of the system. This will be where the end-users will spend their time. The presentation of data needs to be as simple as possible to understand. The coaching staff is no technical experts. The system is  aimed for them to use. Therefor the system will need to present statistics and other valuable information in clean and understandable way. In the end it is the 11 players the coach selects that performs all the actions, but the coach sets the style of play boundary's for players. 

We purpose a web interface here as it is accessible from many devices as long as you have a Internet connection and a up to date web browser.
